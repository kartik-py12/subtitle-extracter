# subtitle-extracter
The code uses the Selenium library to automate the extraction of subtitles from a video page on the JioCinema website. It sets up a Chrome WebDriver to interact with the Opera GX browser. After opening the video URL, it waits for the subtitle button to load, clicks it, and waits for the subtitles to appear. It then extracts the subtitle content and prints it. The code includes error handling for cases where elements aren't found. It's important to ensure that the ChromeDriver version matches the browser and that the binary location is set correctly. Note that the code's success depends on the website's structure, so adjustments might be needed due to updates or changes on the website.
